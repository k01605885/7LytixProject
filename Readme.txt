2 Jupyter Notebooks
Dataset downloaded from : from https://www.kaggle.com/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci
Notebooks and data files should be in the same folder.


First, I checked the data and did some preprocessing steps in Application_Task_Paul_Grasserbauer_Preprocessing.ipynb

In the end there would be a file weekly.csv 

I also added this file to Git.

Within the second Notebook (Application_Task_Paul_Grasserbauer_Forecast.ipynb) I tried to forecast the data and used the weekly.csv file as data source.
